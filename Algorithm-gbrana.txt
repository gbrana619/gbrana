Algorith for Assignment 1 - By Gyan Bahadur Rana

Main program Flow

Step 1 - Take the date of birth in four formats.
          i.e. "YYYYMMDD", "YYYY/MM/DD", "YYYY-MM-DD", and "YYYY.MM.DD"

Step 2 - Remove all the non-digit characters from the input date of birth.
          i.e. "/",".","-"

Step 3 - Extract the year, month, and day from the input data.

Step 4 - Convert the provided 2 digit month into the corresponding three letter abbreviated month name.
          i.e. Convert 10 into Oct or 01 into Jan.

Step 5 - Rearrange the year, month, and day into the required format or Standard format.
          i.e. mmm d, yyyy

Step 6 - Send the rearranged data to standard output.


Validation function

def leap_year(obj) - This Function checks if the given year(obj) in date of birth is leap year or not. This function returns
                 True if the given year is leap year, otherwise Fasle. February 
                 month in leap year has 29 days but in non-leap years February has 28 days.
                 Therefore, this function allow to input 29 days for February if the date of birth is a
                 leap year if not it will deny the entry. 


def sanitize(obj1,obj2) -  This Function has 2 objects. Obj1 conatins the date of birth given by the user and obj2 conatins allowed
              letters i.e. 0-9 digits. This function removes characters from obj1 that are not in obj2 and return new obj1. This 
              function will remove the non-digit characters i.e "/",".","-" from the input date of
              birth and output only digit number. For instance, Input = "2020/10/20" Output = "20201020"


def size_check(obj, intobj) - This Function checks the lengths of the obj returned by sanitize Function. Intobj conatins the allowed size
               in integer and if the size of obj matches the intobj then it returns True, othersies False.This function will check the 
               size of the entered date of birth and will only allow the date of birth will 8 digits. For instance, Input = "2020/10/20"
               is allowed but Input = "2020/101/20" is not allowed.

def range_check(obj1, obj2)check() - This Function checks the range of obj1. obj2 contains the two range values in integer; first one is lower
                                     bound of the range and second one is upper bound of the range. If the range of obj1 matches range of obj2 
                                     then it returns True, otherwies False. This function will check the range of specified years and month. For 
                                     instance, it will allow the date of birth year from 1900 to 9999 only and for months 1 to 12 only.


Usage() -  This function will check if the provided data or argument is only date of birth and nothing more is
	   accepeted. For instance, Input = "2020/10/20" is accepted but if the Input = "2020/10/20 Gyan rana"
           this function will reject this input and provide a usage message like "Usage: a1_gbrana.py YYYYMMDD|YYYY-MM-DD|YYYY/MM/DD|YYYY.MM.DD".
