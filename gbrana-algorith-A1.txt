                 month in leap year has 29 days but in non-leap years February has 28 days.

 	       allow the date of birth will 8 digits. For instance, Input = "2020/10/20" is allowed but
	       Input = "2020/101/20" is not allowed.


Range_check() - This function will check the range of specified years and month. For instance, it will
		allow the date of birth year from 1900 to 9999 only and for months 1 to 12 only.


Usage() -  This function will check if the provided data is only date of birth and nothing more is
	   accepeted. For instance, Input = "2020/10/20" is accepted but if the Input = "2020/10/20 Gyan rana"
